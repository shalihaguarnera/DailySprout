Hello!

DailySprout is a mental health and sentiment tracking app currently in its early stages of development. 

The app will include:
1. Sprout Log: This is where the user will record their day. The user will be prompted with a few questions, such as rating their day, asking about their activities, and more, with predetermined answer options.
   Afterward, the user will be prompted to type and journal their thoughts about that day. This will then be used to detect sentiment, tone, and specific emotions. Data recorded for this day will be stored.

2. Reports: Users can view data visualizations, graphs, and infographics of the information recorded from the log. Users can view their mood fluctuation over time and other relevant statistics.

3. Calendar: Users will view a calendar tracking their daily logs. Users can select specific days to view the log for that day. Additionally, users can edit past logs through this feature.
